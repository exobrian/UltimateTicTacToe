### Welcome to Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe!

This is an extreme version of traditional tic-tac-toe that my coworker showed me how to play. I decided to code it using Python to practice my Python skills along with learning more about Pygame. There's also some polymorphism and other software development principles I tried to sprinkle in.

### How to play:
------
To begin, the first player can click into any square in any inner tic-tac-toe on the board.
<br>

<br>

Once a player has gone, the next player must select a square that is located in an inner tic-tac-toe board that corresponds to the location of the square clicked in that board. 
<br>

<br>

The game will highlight the last player's move in green to remind the current player where they may go.
<br>

<br>

Once a player has **won** an inner square, a colored line will indicate that that inner square *belongs* to that player and no other player may win that inner square. All players may continue to move into the inner square however.
<br>

<br>

Play will continue until a player wins three inner squares that are connected in one single line.

<br>

The game will end and declare that player the winner once this happens. **Congratulations!**
