### Welcome to Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe!

This is an extreme version of traditional tic-tac-toe that my coworker showed me how to play. I decided to code it using Python to practice my Python skills along with learning more about Pygame. There's also some polymorphism and other software development principles I tried to sprinkle in.

### How to play:
------
To begin, the first player can click into any square in any inner tic-tac-toe on the board.

Once a player has gone, the next player must select a square that is located in an inner tic-tac-toe board that corresponds to the location of the square the clicked in that board.

The game will highlight the last player's move in green to remind the current player where they may go.
